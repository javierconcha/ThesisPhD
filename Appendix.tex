$a_{YS}$ cannot be determined directly. An approximation of $a_{YS}$ may be obtained by a spectrophotometer scan of a filtered sample (\cite{Bukata1995}, p.125). Spectrophotometer used in normal mode do not measure true absorbance but {\color{red} attenuance} because all the scattered light is measured. To overcome this, the cells can be placed close to a wide photomultiplier (\cite{Kirk1983}, p.51).

\section{$R_{rs}$}

method described by \cite{Mobley:1999} for measuring the spectra of the downwelling irradiance $E_d$, the surface reflected sky radiance $L_s$, and the water-leaving radiance $L_w$ for each site 

This section describes how to take the remote-sensing measurement using a single instrument that measures radiance (spectroradiometer or spectrometer) such as an SVC or ASD instrument. This procedure is taken from \cite{Mobley:1999} and \cite{Mueller1995}. 

The remote-sensing reflectance $R_{rs}$ is defined as

\begin{equation}\label{eq:Rrs}
	R_{rs}(\theta,\phi,\lambda)=\frac{L_w(\theta,\phi,\lambda)}{E_d(\lambda)}
\end{equation}
where $L_w$ is the water-leaving radiance in the polar and azimuthal directions $\theta$ and $\phi$, respectively, and $E_d$ is the downwelling spectral plane irradiance incident onto the water surface. A radiometer pointing down toward the water surface in direction $(\pi-\theta,\phi)$ does not directly measure $L_w$. Instead, it measures $L_w$  plus any incident sky radiance reflected $L_r$ by the water surface into the field of view of the sensor. This total radiance at the sensor $L_t$ is define as

\begin{equation}\label{eq:Lt}
	L_t(\theta,\phi) = L_r(\theta,\phi)+L_w(\theta,\phi)\Rightarrow L_w(\theta,\phi)=L_t(\theta,\phi) - L_r(\theta,\phi)
\end{equation}

The term $L_r$ can be replaced by

\begin{equation}\label{eq:Lsky}
	L_r = \rho L_{sky}
\end{equation}
where $\rho$ is the proportionality factor that relates the radiance measured when the sensor views the sky to the reflected sky radiance measured when the sensor views the water surface. \cite{Mobley:1999} suggests to use $\rho \approx 0.028$ for a sensor view angle $\theta_v \approx 40^\circ$ from the nadir and  $\phi_v \approx 135^\circ$ from the Sun with the constraints of a clear sky and wind speed less than $5m/s$.

Although $E_d$ could be measured directly with an appropriate sensor, it will be estimated from the radiance measured from a Lambertian surface (Spectralon) because both instruments in this case (SVC and ASD) are set to measure radiance. When an irradiance $E_d$ falls in a Lambertian surface with a known irradiance reflectance $R_g$, the uniform radiance $L_g$ leaving the surface is given by 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:Lg}
	L_g = (R_g/\pi)E_d\Rightarrow E_d = L_g*\pi/R_g
\end{equation}

Applying \autoref{eq:Lt} ,\autoref{eq:Lsky} and \autoref{eq:Lg} in \autoref{eq:Rrs} yields

\begin{equation}
	R_{rs} = \frac{L_t-\rho L_{sky}}{\frac{\displaystyle \pi}{\displaystyle R_g}L_g}
\end{equation}

\subsection{ASD}

The ASD should be in ``radiance mode''. Three different radiance measurements need to be taken:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $L_g$: pointing the Spectralon

Description: $L_g$ is measured with the sensor pointing downward in the same direction as is used in viewing the water surface (see \autoref{fig:Ltmea}), while the Spectralon is inserted into the sensor FOV. The Spectralon should be normal to the water surface.

	\item $L_t$: pointing the water surface

Description: $L_t$ is measured with the sensor pointing downward toward the water surface in the direction $\approx \pi-\theta_v = 140^\circ$ from nadir with $\theta_v = 40^\circ$ and $\phi_v \approx 135^\circ$ or $\phi_v \approx -135^\circ$ from the Sun as illustrated in \autoref{fig:Ltmea}.

    \vspace{0.5cm}
   \caption[]{\label{fig:Ltmea} $L_t$ measurement.}
\end{figure}

	\item $L_{sky}$: pointing the sky

Description: $L_{sky}$ is measured with the sensor pointing upward toward the sky in the direction $\approx \theta_v = 40^\circ$ from nadir and $\phi_v \approx 135^\circ$ or $\phi_v \approx -135^\circ$ from the Sun as illustrated in \autoref{fig:Lskymea}.

    \vspace{0.5cm}
   \caption[]{\label{fig:Lskymea} $L_{sky}$ measurement.}
\end{figure}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{SVC}
The same three radiance measurements described above need to be taken:

\begin{itemize}
	\item $L_g$: pointing the Spectralon

Description: The measurement is taken in the same fashion described in the previous section and it is taken only once per site. When the SVC instrument is used in ``reflectance mode'', it is necessary to measure first an standard measurement (Spectralon measurement). This standard measurement is the $L_r$ and is recorded internally in the ``sig'' file. Therefore, $L_r$ needs to be extracted from the later from the ``sig'' file. 

	\item $L_t$: pointing the water surface

Description: $L_t$ is measured in the same fashion described in the previous section. However, this measurement is saved internally in the ``sig'' file after the standard measurement column ($L_g$).

	\item $L_{sky}$: pointing the sky	

Description: $L_{sky}$ is measured in the same fashion described in the previous section. However, this measurement is saved internally in the ``sig'' file after the standard measurement column ($L_g$).

\end{itemize}
{\bf Notes:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Wear dark clothes, preferable black.
	\item Avoid any reflection from nearby objects in the boat or ship.
