\section{Remote-sensing Reflectance (\texorpdfstring{$R_{rs}$}{Rrs})}

% method described by \citet{Mobley:1999} for measuring the spectra of the downwelling irradiance $E_d$, the surface reflected sky radiance $L_s$, and the water-leaving radiance $L_w$ for each site 

This section describes how to take the remote-sensing measurement using a single instrument that measures radiance (spectroradiometer or spectrometer) such as a SVC \citep{SVCHR1024i} or an ASD \citep{ASDManual2012} instrument. This procedure is taken from \citep{Mobley:1999} and \citep{Mueller1995}. 

Recall that the \gls{rrs} (\autoref{eq:Rrs}) is defined as

\begin{equation}\label{eq:RrsAppendix}
	R_{rs}(\theta,\phi,\lambda)=\frac{L_w(\theta,\phi,\lambda)}{E_d(\lambda)}
\end{equation}
where $L_w$ is the water-leaving radiance in the polar and azimuthal directions $\theta$ and $\phi$, respectively, and $E_d$ is the downwelling spectral plane irradiance incident onto the water surface. A radiometer pointing down toward the water surface in direction $(\pi-\theta,\phi)$ does not directly measure $L_w$. Instead, it measures $L_w$  plus any incident sky radiance reflected $L_r$ by the water surface into the field of view of the sensor. This total radiance at the sensor $L_t$ is define as

\begin{equation}\label{eq:Lt}
	L_t(\theta,\phi) = L_r(\theta,\phi)+L_w(\theta,\phi)\Rightarrow L_w(\theta,\phi)=L_t(\theta,\phi) - L_r(\theta,\phi)
\end{equation}

The term $L_r$ can be replaced by

\begin{equation}\label{eq:Lsky}
	L_r = \rho L_{sky}
\end{equation}
where $\rho$ is the proportionality factor that relates the radiance measured when the sensor views the sky to the reflected sky radiance measured when the sensor views the water surface. \citet{Mobley:1999} suggests to use $\rho \approx 0.028$ for a sensor view angle $\theta_v \approx 40^\circ$ from the nadir and  $\phi_v \approx 135^\circ$ from the Sun with the constraints of a clear sky and wind speed less than $5m/s$.

Although $E_d$ could be measured directly with an appropriate sensor, it will be estimated from the radiance measured from a Lambertian surface (Spectralon) because both instruments in this case (SVC and ASD) are set to measure radiance. When an irradiance $E_d$ falls in a Lambertian surface with a known irradiance reflectance $R_g$, the uniform radiance $L_g$ leaving the surface is given by 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:Lg}
	L_g = (R_g/\pi)E_d\Rightarrow E_d = L_g*\pi/R_g
\end{equation}

Applying \autoref{eq:Lt}, \autoref{eq:Lsky} and \autoref{eq:Lg} in \autoref{eq:RrsAppendix} yields

\begin{equation}\label{eq:RrsFinalAppendix}
	R_{rs} = \frac{L_t-\rho L_{sky}}{\frac{\displaystyle \pi}{\displaystyle R_g}L_g}
\end{equation}

Therefore, from \autoref{eq:RrsFinalAppendix}, there are three quantities that need to be measured in a consecutive order: $L_g$, $L_t$, and $L_{sky}$. The procedures for taking these three measurements in the field will be explained for both the ASD and the SVC instrument.

% ------------------------------------
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{$R_{rs}$}{Rrs} measurement using the ASD}

The ASD instrument should be the ``radiance mode''. Three different radiance measurements need to be taken:
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=2pt,parsep=2pt]
	\item $L_g$: pointing the Spectralon

Description: $L_g$ is measured with the sensor pointing downward in the same direction as is used in viewing the water surface (see \autoref{fig:Ltmea}), while the Spectralon is inserted into the sensor FOV. The Spectralon should be normal to the water surface.

	\item $L_t$: pointing the water surface

Description: $L_t$ is measured with the sensor pointing downward toward the water surface in the direction $\approx \pi-\theta_v = 140^\circ$ from nadir with $\theta_v = 40^\circ$ and $\phi_v \approx 135^\circ$ or $\phi_v \approx -135^\circ$ from the Sun as illustrated in \autoref{fig:Ltmea}.

    \vspace{0.5cm}
   \caption[]{\label{fig:Ltmea} $L_t$ measurement.}
\end{figure}

	\item $L_{sky}$: pointing the sky

Description: $L_{sky}$ is measured with the sensor pointing upward toward the sky in the direction $\approx \theta_v = 40^\circ$ from nadir and $\phi_v \approx 135^\circ$ or $\phi_v \approx -135^\circ$ from the Sun as illustrated in \autoref{fig:Lskymea}.

\begin{figure}[htb]

    \vspace{0.5cm}
   \caption[]{\label{fig:Lskymea} $L_{sky}$ measurement.}
\end{figure}

\end{itemize}

% ------------------------------------
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{$R_{rs}$}{Rrs} measurement using the SVC}
The same three radiance measurements described above need to be taken:

\begin{itemize}[itemsep=2pt,parsep=2pt]
	\item $L_g$: pointing the Spectralon

Description: The measurement is taken in the same fashion described in the previous section and it is taken only once per site. When the SVC instrument is used in ``reflectance mode'', it is necessary to measure first an standard measurement (Spectralon measurement). This standard measurement is the $L_r$ and is recorded internally in the ``sig'' file. Therefore, $L_r$ needs to be extracted from the later from the ``sig'' file. 

	\item $L_t$: pointing the water surface

Description: $L_t$ is measured in the same fashion described in the previous section. However, this measurement is saved internally in the ``sig'' file after the standard measurement column ($L_g$).

	\item $L_{sky}$: pointing the sky	

Description: $L_{sky}$ is measured in the same fashion described in the previous section. However, this measurement is saved internally in the ``sig'' file after the standard measurement column ($L_g$).

\end{itemize}
{\bf Notes:}
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=2pt,parsep=2pt]
  \item A good way to find these angles in the field is to find your shadow, and point the instrument $-45^\circ$ or $45^\circ$ from it, which is equivalent to $\phi_v \approx 135^\circ$ or $\phi_v \approx -135^\circ$.

	\item Wear dark clothes, preferable black, to avoid contamination from adjacent objects.

	\item Avoid any reflection from nearby objects in the boat or ship by covering the ship's side with a black turf. 
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Lab Measurements}
\label{ch:labmea} 

This part of the appendix describes how to take the lab measurements from the water samples. \autoref{fig:ProtocolsDiagram} shows a diagram of the different methods. These measurements included concentration and spectral absorption coefficients of particles, dissolved material and phytoplankton (\gls{cpas}).

% $a_{YS}$ cannot be determined directly. An approximation of $a_{YS}$ may be obtained by a spectrophotometer scan of a filtered sample (\citep{Bukata1995}, p.125). Spectrophotometer used in normal mode do not measure true absorbance but {\color{red} attenuance} because all the scattered light is measured. To overcome this, the cells can be placed close to a wide photomultiplier (\citep{Kirk1983}, p.51).
% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{IOPs}
%*******************************
The \gls{iops}, specifically the spectral absorption coefficients, are obtained from spectrophotometric measurements of samples prepared from filtration of water samples. These methods are described by \citet{Mitchell2002}. In brief, the total absorption coefficient for natural water can be defined as \citep{Mitchell2002}
\begin{equation}
  a_{total}(\lambda) = a_w(\lambda) + a_p(\lambda) + a_g(\lambda)~~[m^{-1}] 
\end{equation}
\noindent where $a_w(\lambda)$, $a_p(\lambda)$, and $a_g(\lambda)$ are the spectral absorption coefficients of water, particles, and soluble components, respectively. $a_p(\lambda)$ can be decomposed as
\begin{equation}
  a_p(\lambda) = a_\phi(\lambda) + a_d(\lambda)~~[m^{-1}] 
\end{equation}
\noindent where $a_\phi(\lambda)$ and $a_d(\lambda)$ are the spectral absorption coefficients of phytoplankton and de-pigmented particles, respectively. $a_\phi$, $a_d$, $a_g$ are referred in \autoref{eq:atotal} as $a_{Chl}$, $a_{SM}$ and $a_{CDOM}$, respectively. The main idea is to first measure $a_p(\lambda)$ and $a_d(\lambda)$ from a dual-beam spectrophotometer, and then obtain $a_\phi(\lambda)$ as $a_\phi(\lambda)=a_p(\lambda)$ - $a_d(\lambda)$.

A dual-beam spectrophotometer is an instrument that measures the amount of light that passes a medium, i.e. transmittance, using two paths, one for the reference, and one for the sample. The spectrophotometer used was a Shimadzu \gls{uv}-\gls{vis} recording spectrophotometer, model UV-2100U. One the output of the instrument is the dimensionless quantity \gls{od} (a.k.a. absorbance). 

The water sample is filtered, and a $OD_{fp}(\lambda)$ is measured using the spectrophotometer. $OD_{fp}(\lambda)$ is a measurement of the \gls{od} of the retained particles. Then, the filter is soaked in chemical solvent to extract phytoplankton pigments \citep{Kishino1985cj}. At this point, the filter only retained the de-pigmented particles, and $OD_{fd}(\lambda)$ is measured. The conversion from \gls{od} to absorption coefficients is \citep{Cleveland1993}
\begin{equation}
  a_p = \frac{\displaystyle 2.3 OD_{susp}(\lambda)}{V/A}
\end{equation}
\noindent where 2.3 is a conversion from $\log$ base $10$ to $\log$ base $e$, $V~[m^3]$ is the volume filtered, $A~[m^2]$ is the clearance area of the filter. $OD_{susp}$ is obtained from $OD_{fp}$ or $OD_{fd}$ after a scattering correction for glass-fiber filter proposed by \citet{Cleveland1993} as
\begin{equation}
   OD_{susp}(\lambda) = 0.378 (OD_{fp}(\lambda)-OD_{fp}(750nm)) + 0.523 (OD_{fp}(\lambda)-OD_{fp}(750nm))^2
 \end{equation} 
 \noindent where $OD_{fp}$ is the optical density of the filter before methanol extraction. $a_d$ is obtained in a similar fashion. In the following section, the procedure to measure $OD_{fp}$ and $OD_{fd}$ in the lab are presented.

A new initialization window that check the system pops up. Wait until it is finished. Note: make sure the beam paths are empty before initialize the instrument
  \item Pour DIW water to two GF/F Whatman filters and stick them in the two-lenses support. Both filter should have the same amount of water. Add water with the pipette or the squirt bottle
  \item Place the two-lenses support in the spectrophotometer
  \item Press the Baseline button in the UV-2101PC software
  \item Perform an scanner to see the baseline level of the instrument by pressing the ``Start'' button in the software
  \item Press the ``Go To WL'' button of the software and type $850 [nm]$. Press the ``Auto Zero'' button of the software (optional)
  \item Shake water sample bottle a couple of times to mix by turbulence and ensure large particles that settle at the bottom are re-suspended \citep{Mitchell2002}
  \item \label{item:place_filter} Using the forceps, place the filter on the filter base and place the filter cup on the base. 
  \item Pour the desired amount of water in a graduated cylinder
  \item \label{item:filtration} Turn the vacuum pump on and turn the knob $90^\circ$ to allow filtration. Once all the water pass through the filter, turn the know $90^\circ$ back and the turn the vacuum pump off. \textbf{Record volume filtered}
  \item Using the forceps, take the filter used for the baseline (closer to the front of the instrument) from the two-lenses support and storage it for future baselines. Do not remove the reference filter (closer to the back of the instrument) for the whole measurement session
  \item \label{item:place_filter_spec} Using the forceps, take the sample filter from the filtering tower and stick in the two lenses support. Add one or a few water drops to the sample filter if needed 
  \item  Measure absorbance in the spectrophotometer by pressing the ``Start'' button of the software. This will be the $OD_{fp}$ measurement
  \item Once the scan is finished, input a name for the file and press OK
  \item Using the forceps, remove carefully the sample filter from two lenses support avoiding to break it and place in the filter tower as in step \ref{item:place_filter}
  \item Pour enough solvent (hot methanol) to soak the filter in the filter cup, and filter methanol. The solvent should be disposed in a different flask from the only water filtering
  \item Pour enough solvent (hot methanol) to soak the filter in the filter cup.  Wait 10 min. Check level of solvent frequently and add more if needed. Then, filter as in step \ref{item:filtration}
  \item Pour some purified water and filter again\todo{look reference!}

  \item The instrument only allows to save 10 measurement, or channels, at the time. 
  \item Add sporadically purified water drops to the reference filter to avoid it to dry
  \item Repeat baseline measurement if needed
\end{itemize}

  \item Use cotton sweep to clean internal face (optional, if face seems dirty)
  \item Rinse cell with purified water
  \item Clean and dry the external surface of the cells with optics paper. Be careful with scratching the surface, specially the front and bottom faces
  \item Select a Slit Width equal to $5.0~[nm]$ in the photometer software
  \item Select a Sampling Interval of $1~[nm]$ or $2~[nm]$ in the photometer software
  \item Fill both cells with purified water and extract bubbles
  \item Place both blank and sample cells filled with purified water in the sample compartment of the spectrophotometer
  \item Press ``Auto Zero'' button in the spectrophotometer software
  \item Press ``Baseline'' button in the spectrophotometer software
  \item Fill sample cell with filtered water from the syringe filter
  \item Press start button to start scan. This measurement is $OD_s(\lambda)$
  \item Save Channel in the spectrophotometer software. Go to Data Translation $>$ ASCII Export in spectrophotometer software
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Important:} the samples should be at room temperature. The \gls{od} measurement is sensible to temperature changes. Filter the water samples in advance and let them reach room temperature. It could take hours.
