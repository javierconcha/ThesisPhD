  Abstract                 = {Abstract Satellite remote sensing has shown the advantage of water quality assessment at synoptic scales in coastal regions, yet modern sensors such as SeaWiFS or MODIS did not start until the late 1990s. For non-interrupted observations, only the Landsat series have the potential to detect major water quality events since the 1980s. However, such ability is hindered by the unknown data quality or consistency through time. Here, using the Florida Keys as a case study, we demonstrate an approach to identify historical water quality events through improved atmospheric correction of Landsat data and cross-validation with concurrent MODIS data. After aggregation of the Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) 30-m pixels to 240-m pixels (to increase the signal-to-noise ratio), a MODIS-like atmospheric correction approach using the Landsat shortwave-infrared (SWIR) bands was developed and applied to the entire Landsat-5 TM data series between 1985 and 2010. Remote sensing reflectance (RRS) anomalies from Landsat (2 standard deviations from a pixel-specific monthly climatology) were found to detect MODIS RRS anomalies with over 90% accuracy for all three bands for the same period of 2002--2010. Extending this analysis for the entire Landsat-5 time-series revealed RRS anomaly events in the 1980s and 1990s, some of which are corroborated by known ecosystem changes due in part to changes in local freshwater flow. Indeed, TM RRS anomalies were shown to be useful in detecting shifts in seagrass density, turbidity increases, black water events, and phytoplankton blooms. These findings have large implications for ongoing and future water quality assessment in the Florida Keys as well as in many other coastal regions.},

  Abstract                 = {We present an overview of the calibration of the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of View Sensor (SeaWiFS) from its performance verification at the manufacturer's facility to the completion of its third year of on-orbit measurements. These calibration procedures have three principal parts: a prelaunch radiometric calibration that is traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technology; the Transfer-to-Orbit Experiment, a set of measurements that determine changes in the instrument's calibration from its manufacture to the start of on-orbit operations; and measurements of the sun and the moon to determine radiometric changes on orbit. To our knowledge, SeaWiFS is the only instrument that uses routine lunar measurements to determine changes in its radiometric sensitivity. On the basis of these methods, the overall uncertainty in the SeaWiFS top-of-the-atmosphere radiances is estimated to be 4-5%. We also show the results of comparison campaigns with aircraft- and ground-based measurements, plus the results of an experiment, called the Southern Ocean Band 8 Gain Study. These results are used to check the calibration of the SeaWiFS bands. To date, they have not been used to change the instrument's prelaunch calibration coefficients. In addition to these procedures, SeaWiFS is a vicariously calibrated instrument for ocean-color measurements. In the vicarious calibration of the SeaWiFS visible bands, the calibration coefficients are modified to force agreement with surface truth measurements from the Marine Optical Buoy, which is moored off the Hawaiian Island of Lanai, This vicarious calibration is described in a companion paper.

  Abstract                 = {
The most interaction between humankind and water occurs in coastal and inland waters (Case 2 waters) at a scale of tens or hundred of meters, but there is not yet an ocean color product at this spatial scale. Landsat 8 is a promising candidate to address the remote sensing of these kinds of waters due to its improved signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), spectral resolution, 12-bit quantization, and high spatial resolution. Standard atmospheric correction algorithms developed for heritage ocean color instruments (e.g. MODIS, SeaWiFS) require a sufficient SNR in two bands where the water-leaving signal is negligible, which is not always possible, particularly for Landsat 8's bands. The model-based empirical line method (MoB-ELM) atmospheric algorithm for Landsat 8 imagery does not rely on this assumption. In this work, we evaluate the performance of this algorithm. We compare the MoB-ELM algorithm with in situ data and with three standard atmospheric correction algorithms. The results from our algorithm are comparable with the standard algorithms in some bands when comparing remote-sensing reflectances. When compared with in situ remote-sensing reflectance, the MoB-ELM perform similar to the standard algorithm in most cases. A comparison of retrieved chlorophyll-a concentration was perform as well, showing that the MoB- ELM outperforms the rest at high concentrations commonly found in Case 2 waters. These results show that our atmospheric correction algorithm allows one to use Landsat 8 to study Case 2 waters as an alternative to heritage ocean color satellites.

  Abstract                 = {We present an overview of the vicarious calibration of the Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS). This program has three components: the calibration of the near-infrared bands so that the atmospheric correction algorithm retrieves the optical properties of maritime aerosols in the open ocean; the calibration of the visible bands against in-water measurements from the Marine Optical Buoy (MOBY); and a calibration-verification program that uses comparisons between SeaWiFS retrievals and globally distributed in situ measurements of water-leaving radiances. This paper describes the procedures as implemented for the third reprocessing of the SeaWiFS global mission data set. The uncertainty in the near-infrared vicarious gain is 0.9%. The uncertainties in the visible-band vicarious gains are 0.3%, corresponding to uncertainties in the water-leaving radiances of approximately 3%. The means of the SeaWiFS/in situ matchup ratios for water-leaving radiances are typically within 5% of unity in Case 1 waters, while chlorophyll a ratios are within 1% of unity. SeaWiFS is the first ocean-color mission to use an extensive and ongoing prelaunch and postlaunch calibration program, and the matchup results demonstrate the benefits of a comprehensive approach.

  Abstract                 = {Ocean color climate data records (CDRs) require water-leaving radiances with 5% absolute and 1% relative accuracies as input. Because of the amplification of any sensor calibration errors by the atmospheric correction, the 1% relative accuracy requirement translates into a 0.1% long-term radiometric stability requirement for top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) radiances. The rigorous prelaunch and on-orbit calibration program developed and implemented for Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) by the NASA Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG) has led to the incorporation of significant changes into the on-orbit calibration methodology over the 13-year lifetime of the instrument. Evolving instrument performance and ongoing algorithm refinement have resulted in updates to approaches for the lunar, solar, and vicarious calibration of SeaWiFS. The uncertainties in the calibrated TOA radiances are addressed in terms of accuracy (biases in the measurements), precision (scatter in the measurements), and stability (repeatability of the measurements). The biases are 2%-3% from lunar calibration and 1%-2% from vicarious calibration. The precision is 0.16% from solar signal-to-noise ratios, 0.13% from lunar residuals, and 0.10% from vicarious gains. The long-term stability of the TOA radiances, derived from the lunar time series, is 0.13%. The stability of the vicariously calibrated TOA radiances, incorporating the uncertainties of the in situ measurements and the atmospheric correction, is 0.30%. This stability of the radiometric calibration of SeaWiFS over its 13-year on-orbit lifetime has allowed the OBPG to produce CDRs from the ocean color data set. (C) 2012 Optical Society of America},

OLI includes a suite of relatively narrow spectral bands at 30 m spatial resolution in the visible to shortwave infrared, which makes it a potential tool for ocean color radiometry: measurement of the reflected spectral radiance upwelling from beneath the ocean surface that carries information on the biogeochemical constituents of the upper ocean euphotic zone. To evaluate the potential of OLI to measure ocean color, processing support was implemented in Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor (SeaWiFS) Data Analysis System (SeaDAS), which is an open-source software package distributed by NASA for processing, analysis, and display of ocean remote sensing measurements from a variety of spaceborne multispectral radiometers. Here we describe the implementation of OLI processing capabilities within SeaDAS, including support for various methods of atmospheric correction to remove the effects of atmospheric scattering and absorption and retrieve the spectral remote sensing reflectance (Rrs; srâ?’1). The quality of the retrieved Rrs imagery will be assessed, as will the derived water column constituents, such as the concentration of the phytoplankton pigment chlorophyll a.},

  Abstract                 = {Sensors that can be used for the observation of ocean color in NASA's Earth Observing System era (SeaWiFS, MODIS, and MISR) have been designed with 2-4 times the radiometric sensitivity of the proof-of-concept ocean color instrument CZCS (coastal zone color scanner). To realize an improvement in the retrieval of biologically important ocean parameters, e.g., the concentration of the photosynthetic pigment chlorophyll a, from this increased sensitivity, significantly better atmospheric correction than was applied to CZCS is required. Atmospheric correction improvement necessitates the inclusion of the effects of multiple scattering, which are strongly dependent on the aerosol size distribution, concentration, and absorption properties. We review the basic concepts of atmospheric correction over the oceans and provide the details of the algorithms currently being developed for SeaWiFS, MODIS, and MISR. An alternate correction algorithm that could be of significant value in the coastal zone is described for MISR. Related issues such as the influence of aerosol vertical structure in the troposphere, polarization of the light field, sea surface roughness, and oceanic whitecaps on the sea surface are evaluated and plans for their inclusion in the algorithm are described. Unresolved issues, such as the presence of stratospheric aerosol, the appropriateness of the aerosol models used in the assessment of multiple scattering, and the identification of, and difficulties associated with the correction for, the presence of absorbing aerosols, e.g., urban pollution or mineral dust, are identified, and suggestions are provided for their resolution.},

  Abstract                 = {The second generation of ocean-color-analyzing instruments requires more accurate atmospheric correction than does the Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS), if one is to utilize fully their increased radiometric sensitivity. Unlike the CZCS, the new instruments possess bands in the near infrared (NIR) that are solely for aiding atmospheric correction. We show, using aerosol models, that certain assumptions regarding the spectral behavior of the aerosol reflectance employed in the standard CZCS correction algorithm are not valid over the spectral range encompassing both the visible and the NIR. Furthermore, we show that multiple-scattering effects on the algorithm depend significantly on the aerosol model. Following these observations, we propose an algorithm that utilizes the NIR bands for atmospheric correction to the required accuracy. Examples of the dependence of the error on the aerosol model, the turbidity of the atmosphere, and surface roughness (waves) are provided. The error in the retrieved phytoplankton-pigment concentration (the principal product of ocean-color sensors) induced by errors in the atmospheric correction are shown to be \&lt;20\% in approximately 90\% of the cases examined. Finally, the aerosol thickness ($\tau$a) is estimated through a simple extension of the correction algorithm. Simulations suggest that the error in the recovered value of $\tau$a should be ? 10\%.},

 serious confounding factor for benthic remote sensing in shallow-water
 environments. This problem was recently overcome by Hochberg et al., who
 provided an effective method for the removal of `sun glint' from
 remotely sensed images by utilization of the brightness in a
 near-infrared (NIR) band. Application of the technique was shown to give
 an increase in the accuracy of benthic habitat classification. However,
 as presented, the method is sensitive to outlier pixels, requires a
 time-consuming masking of land and cloud, and is not formulated in a
 manner leading to ease of implementation. We present a revised version
 of the method, which is more robust, does not require masking and can be
 implemented very simply. The practical approach described here will
 hopefully expedite the routine adoption of this effective and simple
 technique throughout the aquatic remote sensing community.}},

  Abstract                 = {{A significant number of high spatial resolution (4 in) Ikonos images
 acquired over shallow coastal environments present quasi-stochastic sea
 surface effects that seriously compromise reconnaissance of bottom
 features. This problem is common in wide field-of-view images where
 there is limited control on acquisition conditions other than cloud
 cover. To eliminate most of these wave and glint patterns, we use the
 near-infrared band, which exhibits maximum absorption and minimal water
 leaving radiance over clear waters, to characterize the spatial
 distribution of relative glint intensity, which is then scaled by
 absolute glint intensities in each of the visible bands. The result is
 subtracted from the visible bands, thus filtering out glint effects.
 Corrected visible bands clearly reveal seabed structural features
 obscured in the original data. Before- and after-correction
 classifications of an Ikonos image of Lee Stocking Island (Bahamas)
 reveal an improvement of user's accuracies for critical benthic habitat
 classes such as coral-dominated habitat (46.8\% versus 60.5\%) or dense
 seagrass beds (31.7\% versus 52.1\%). This technique offers potential to
 use previously discarded sections of high spatial resolution airborne or
 satellite images of optically shallow water for mapping substrate
 features.}},

Past and current sensors used different signal levels, formats, and conventions to specify these critical parameters, making it difficult to make cross-sensor comparisons or to establish standards for future sensor design. The goal of this study is to quantify these parameters under uniform conditions for widely used past and current sensors in order to provide a reference for the design of future ocean color radiometers. Using measurements from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer onboard the Aqua satellite (MODISA) under various solar zenith angles (SZAs), typical (Ltypical) and maximum (Lmax) at-sensor radiances from the visible to the shortwave IR were determined. The Ltypical values at an SZA of 45\&\#xB0; were used as constraints to calculate SNRs of 10 multiband sensors at the same Ltypical radiance input and 2 hyperspectral sensors at a similar radiance input. The calculations were based on clear-water scenes with an objective method of selecting pixels with minimal cross-pixel variations to assure target homogeneity. Among the widely used ocean color sensors that have routine global coverage, MODISA ocean bands (1\&\#xA0;km) showed 2\&\#x2013;4 times higher SNRs than the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) (1\&\#xA0;km) and comparable SNRs to the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS)-RR (reduced resolution, 1.2\&\#xA0;km), leading to different levels of precision in the retrieved Chl data product. MERIS-FR (full resolution, 300\&\#xA0;m) showed SNRs lower than MODISA and MERIS-RR with the gain in spatial resolution. SNRs of all MODISA ocean bands and SeaWiFS bands (except the SeaWiFS near-IR bands) exceeded those from prelaunch sensor specifications after adjusting the input radiance to Ltypical. The tabulated Ltypical, Lmax, and SNRs of the various multiband and hyperspectral sensors under the same or similar radiance input provide references to compare sensor performance in product precision and to help design future missions such as the Geostationary Coastal and Air Pollution Events (GEO-CAPE) mission and the Pre-Aerosol-Clouds-Ecosystems (PACE) mission currently being planned by the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).},

  Abstract                 = {Semianalytical (SA) ocean color models have advantages over conventional band ratio algorithms in that multiple ocean properties can be retrieved simultaneously from a single water-leaving radiance spectrum. However, the complexity of SA models has stalled their development, and operational implementation as optimal SA parameter values are hard to determine because of limitations in development data sets and the lack of robust tuning procedures. We present a procedure for optimizing SA ocean color models for global applications. The SA model to be optimized retrieves simultaneous estimates for chlorophyll (Chl) concentration, the absorption coefficient for dissolved and detrital materials \[acdm(443)\], and the particulate backscatter coefficient \[bbp(443)\] from measurements of the normalized water-leaving radiance spectrum. Parameters for the model are tuned by simulated annealing as the global optimization protocol. We first evaluate the robustness of the tuning method using synthetic data sets, and we then apply the tuning procedure to an in situ data set. With the tuned SA parameters, the accuracy of retrievals found with the globally optimized model (the Garver-Siegel-Maritorena model version 1; hereafter GSM01) is excellent and results are comparable with the current Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view sensor (SeaWiFS) algorithm for Chl. The advantage of the GSM01 model is that simultaneous retrievals of acdm(443) and bbp(443) are made that greatly extend the nature of global applications that can be explored. Current limitations and further developments of the model are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {The Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Goddard Space Flight Center has processed and released 2100 Landsat Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus surface reflectance scenes, providing 30-m resolution wall-to-wall reflectance coverage for North America for epochs centered on 1990 and 2000. This dataset can support decadal assessments of environmental and land-cover change, production of reflectance-based biophysical products, and applications that merge reflectance data from multiple sensors [e.g., the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer, Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)]. The raw imagery was obtained from the orthorectified Landsat GeoCover dataset, purchased by NASA from the Earth Satellite Corporation. Through the LEDAPS project, these data were calibrated, converted to top-of-atmosphere reflectance, and then atmospherically corrected using the MODIS/6S methodology. Initial comparisons with ground-based optical thickness measurements and simultaneously acquired MODIS imagery indicate comparable uncertainty in Landsat surface reflectance compared to the standard MODIS reflectance product (the greater of 0.5% absolute reflectance or 5% of the recorded reflectance value). The rapid automated nature of the processing stream also paves the way for routine high-level products from future Landsat sensors.},

I review the radiative transfer foundations of several commonly used methods for estimating Rrs, and errors associated with estimating Rrs by removal of surface-reflected sky radiance are evaluated using the Hydrolight radiative transfer numerical model. The dependence of the sea surface reflectance factor $\rho$, which is not an inherent optical property of the surface, on sky conditions, wind speed, solar zenith angle, and viewing geometry is examined. If $\rho$ is not estimated accurately, significant errors can occur in the estimated Rrs for near-zenith Sun positions and for high wind speeds, both of which can give considerable Sun glitter effects. The numerical simulations suggest that a viewing direction of 40 deg from the nadir and 135 deg from the Sun is a reasonable compromise among conflicting requirements. For this viewing direction, a value of $\rho$ $\approx$ 0.028 is acceptable only for wind speeds less than 5 m s{\textminus}1. For higher wind speeds, curves are presented for the determination of $\rho$ as a function of solar zenith angle and wind speed. If the sky is overcast, a value of $\rho$ $\approx$ 0.028 is used at all wind speeds.},

  Abstract                 = {{Remote sensing has traditionally been used to retrieve water
 constituents by establishing a relationship between in situ measured
 quantities and image-derived products. Motivated by the dramatically
 improved potential of the Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM), this
 paper describes a different approach for water constituent retrieval
 where both thermal and visible spectral bands of the Enhanced Thematic
 Mapper Plus (ETM+) instrument on board Landsat-7 are utilized. In this
 effort, Landsat data is integrated with a 3D hydrodynamic model to
 obtain profiles of particles and dissolved matter in the near shore zone
 in the vicinity of two river discharges. The procedure is based upon
 performing many hydrodynamic simulations by adjusting input
 environmental/physical variables and generating Look-Up-Tables (LUTs).
 The best match, obtained using optimization, demonstrated an average
 root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) of 0.68 percent, i.e., 0.0068 reflectance
 units, calculated over the two river plumes. It is concluded that
 calibrating a physics-based model using the Landsat-7 imagery can
 provide a more lucid insight into the dynamics of spatially non-uniform
 waters.}},

Measurement of the relative reflectance values from color film imagery requires removal of atmospheric effects. Data processing is particularly crucial because: (1) lakes are the darkest objects in a scene; (2) minor reflec-tance changes can correspond to important physical changes; (3) lake systems extend over broad areas in which atmospheric conditions may fluctuate; (4) seasonal changes are of im-portance; and, (5) effects of weather are important, precluding flights under only ideal weather conditions. Data processing can be accomplished through microdensitometry of scene shadow areas. Measurements of reflectance ratios can be made to an accuracy of $\pm$12%, sufficient to permit monitoring of important eutrophication indices.},

  Abstract                 = {{A major modeling effort has been undertaken to develop and refine tools
 for extracting water quality parameters from remotely-sensed
 hyperspectral imagery. An outgrowth of this work is HydroMod, a new tool
 for calculating radiance distributions using realistic environmental
 conditions for studies involving remote sensing of water quality.
 HydroMod mates two established premier codes, MODTRAN and HYDROLIGHT.
 The idea is to simulate the water-leaving spectral radiance above and
 below the surface for varying inputs of water quality parameters.
 Spectral measurements can then be compared with this family of model
 predicted water-leaving spectral radiance vectors to find a best match
 and subsequently the associated water quality parameters that were used
 to generate the matching curve. The scope of the modeling analysis has
 been limited to the water-leaving radiance in the vicinity of the
 surface instead of the radiance reaching the sensor. Once the modeling
 technique using HydroMod has been refined, the atmospheric correction
 problem over water can be addressed with greater probability of success
 and fewer sources of uncertainty. This paper will describe the
 preliminary results from the model-based approach applied to AVIRIS data
 of a littoral zone and plans for future refinements in the modeling
 physics.}},

Differences in the grey-level distributions of these invariant objects is assumed to be a linear function and is corrected statistically to perform the normalization.

  Abstract                 = {In the remote sensing of the ocean near-surface properties, it is essential to derive accurate water-leaving radiance spectra through the process of the atmospheric correction. The atmospheric correction algorithm for Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor (SeaWiFS) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) uses two near-infrared (NIR) bands at 765 and865 nm (748 and869 nm for MODIS) for retrieval of aerosol properties with assumption of the black ocean at the NIR wavelengths. Modifications are implemented to account for some of the NIR ocean contributions for the productive but not very turbid waters.For turbid waters in the coastal regions, however, the ocean could have significant contributions in the NIR, leading to significant errors in the satellite-derived ocean water-leaving radiances.For the shortwave infrared (SWIR) wavelengths(?1000 nm), water has significantly larger absorption than those for the NIR bands. Thus the black ocean assumption at the SWIR bands is generally valid for turbid waters. In addition, for future sensors, it is also useful to include the UV bands to better quantify the ocean organic and inorganic materials, as well as for help in atmospheric correction. Simulations are carried out to evaluate the performance of atmospheric correction for nonabsorbing and weakly absorbing aerosols using the NIR bands and various combinations of the SWIR bands for deriving the water-leaving radiances at the UV(340 nm) and visible wavelengths. Simulations show that atmospheric correction using the SWIR bands can generally produce results comparable to atmospheric correction using the NIR bands. In particular, the water-leaving radiance at the UV band(340 nm) can also be derived accurately.The results from a sensitivity study for the required sensor noise equivalent reflectance,(NE$\Delta$$\rho$), \[or the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)\] for the NIR and SWIR bands are provided and discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {A method of ocean color data processing using the combined near-infrared (NIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands for atmospheric correction for the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on Aqua is proposed. MODIS-Aqua has been producing the high quality ocean color products in the open oceans, but there are still some significant errors in the derived products in the coastal regions. With the proposed NIR-SWIR combined algorithm, MODIS ocean color data can be processed using the standard (NIR) atmospheric correction algorithm for the open oceans, whereas for the turbid waters in the coastal region the SWIR atmospheric correction algorithm can be executed. The turbid water index developed by Shi and Wang (2007) (Remote Sens. Environ. 110, 149-161 (2007)) is computed prior to the atmospheric correction for the identification of the productive and/or turbid waters where the SWIR algorithm can be operated. For non-turbid ocean waters (discriminated using the turbid water index criterion), the MODIS data are still processed using the standard (NIR) algorithm. The NIR- SWIR combined algorithm has been tested and evaluated. Two examples from MODIS-Aqua measurements along the U. S. and China east coast regions show improved ocean color products with the new approach. In particular, there are no obvious data discontinuities between using the NIR and SWIR methods. Therefore, with the NIR-SWIR combined approach for the MODIS ocean color data processing, good quality ocean color products can be derived both in clear (open) oceans as well as for turbid coastal waters.

  Abstract                 = {Ocean color measured from satellites provides daily, global estimates of marine inherent optical properties (IOPs). Semi-analytical algorithms (SAAs) provide one mechanism for inverting the color of the water observed by the satellite into IOPs. While numerous SAAs exist, most are similarly constructed and few are appropriately parameterized for all water masses for all seasons. To initiate community-wide discussion of these limitations, NASA organized two workshops that deconstructed SAAs to identify similarities and uniqueness and to progress toward consensus on a unified SAA. This effort resulted in the development of the generalized IOP (GIOP) model software that allows for the construction of different SAAs at runtime by selection from an assortment of model parameterizations. As such, GIOP permits isolation and evaluation of specific modeling assumptions, construction of SAAs, development of regionally tuned SAAs, and execution of ensemble inversion modeling. Working groups associated with the workshops proposed a preliminary default configuration for GIOP (GIOP-DC), with alternative model parameterizations and features defined for subsequent evaluation. In this paper, we: (1) describe the theoretical basis of GIOP; (2) present GIOP-DC and verify its comparable performance to other popular SAAs using both in situ and synthetic data sets; and, (3) quantify the sensitivities of their output to their parameterization. We use the latter to develop a hierarchical sensitivity of SAAs to various model parameterizations, to identify components of SAAs that merit focus in future research, and to provide material for discussion on algorithm uncertainties and future emsemble applications.
